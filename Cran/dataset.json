(1) the expansion-controlled trail,\nwhich treats the behavior of the wake behind the body up to a\npoint, along the direction of flight, where the pressure decays to\nthe free-stream value and cooling is controlled principally by the\nexpansion of the flow, and (2) the conduction-controlled trail,\nwhere the trail cools mainly by diffusion of heat away from the\nhigh-temperature core .\n  the influence of the details of the body shape on the\nobservables are discussed and a simple computational procedure for\nthe behavior of the conduction-controlled trail is developed based\non integral methods .  results of calculations that assume\nthermodynamic equilibrium of the flow field give the values of the\nthermodynamic variables in the trail of a sphere, axial\ndistributions of emitted thermal radiation, and maps of electron density\ndistribution .  it is shown that the cooling of the\nconduction-controlled trail is essentially due to conduction of heat and that\nviscous effects are not important .  it is found that this portion\nof the trail does not widen as one proceeds downstream .  flight\nvelocities considered vary between 15,000 and 35,000 ft sec and\naltitudes range between 100,000 and 250,000 ft .\n",

        "content": "some possibilities of using gas mixtures other than in\naerodynamic research .\na study is made of the advantages that can be realized in\ncompressible-flow research by employing a substitute heavy gas in place of air .\nmost heavy gases considered in previous investigations are either toxic,\nchemically active, or (as in the case of the freons) have a ratio of\nspecific heats greatly different from air .  the present report is based\non the idea that by properly mixing a heavy monatomic gas with a\nsuitable heavy polyatomic gas, it is possible to obtain a heavy gas\nmixture which has the correct ratio of specific heats and which is\nnontoxic, nonflammable, thermally stable, chemically inert, and\ncomprised of commercially available components .\ncalculations were made of wind-tunnel characteristics for 63 gas pairs\ncomprising 21 different polyatomic gases properly mixed with each of\nthree monatomic gases (argon, krypton, and xenon) .  for a given\nmach number, reynolds number, and tunnel pressure, a gas-mixture\nwind tunnel having the same specific-heat ratio as air would be\nappreciably smaller and would require much less power than a\ncorresponding air wind tunnel .  analogous though different advantages\ncan be realized in compressor research and in firing-range research .\nthe most significant applications, perhaps, arise through selecting and\nproportioning a gas mixture so as to have at ordinary wind-tunnel\ntemperatures certain dimensionless characteristics which air at\nflight temperatures possesses but which air at ordinary wind-tunnel\ntemperatures does not possess .  characteristics which involve the\nrelaxation time (or bulk viscosity), the variation of viscosity with\ntemperature, and the variation of specific heat with temperature fall\nwithin this category .  other applications arise in heat-transfer\nresearch since certain gas mixtures can be concocted to have any prandtl\nnumber in the range at least between 0.2 and 0.8 .\n",

        "content": "an improved smoke generator for use in the visualisation\nof airflow, particularly boundary layer flow at high\nreynolds numbers .\nand rapid method by which boundary\nlayer flow was rendered visible has been\npreviously described in the journal of the royal\naeronautical society .  it gave promise of\nbeing useful at the highest tunnel speeds provided\na denser smoke could be obtained, which at\nthe same time was free from the troublesome deposits\nassociated with the wood smoke .\nof the aerodynamics division attempts were made\nby the fuel research station to improve the\ndensity of the wood smoke and to reduce the\ndeposits .  these they showed were conflicting\nrequirements, and whilst some improvement\nwas effected, it was not sufficient for observation\nin the new tunnels at high speeds .\n  the staff of the director-general of scientific\nresearch and development, ministry of supply,\nwas then approached and it was decided to\ndevelop an oil smoke generator from a simple\ngenerator of this type which was demonstrated\nto us .  this has been done successfully .\nthe final apparatus in contrast to the wood smoke\ngenerator is light and compact .  it takes\nonly a few minutes to start and can be run as long as desired .\nimprovement on the wood smoke both as regards\ndensity and freedom from deposits, which cause\npremature transition .  the density and quality\nof the smoke are now under control .  smokes\nranging from a light smoke of bluish white colour\nto a heavy smoke dense white in appearance\ncan be obtained .  the oil smoke retains the\nadvantages of the wood smoke in that it is\nnon-corrosive and non-irritant, and the smell can be\ntolerated even when it is present in a considerable\nconcentration .  a certain amount of condensation\nis inevitable with oil smokes, but with suitable\nprecautions troubles arising from this can be\navoided .  a dry solid smoke made by melting a\nhard wax was successfully generated with the\nsame apparatus .  unfortunately because of its\nflocculent nature this smoke gave rise to solid\ndeposits when passed through bore tubing,\nleading eventually to complete blockage .  this\nseems to be a feature of solid smokes .\n  the apparatus has been used to determine\ntransition and laminar separation points on model\nwings in a number of the national physical\nlaboratory tunnels .  smoke filaments have been\nmaintained in the laminar state up to wind\nspeeds of 180 ft. sec. in the new tunnels .\n  there is much to be said for making a standard\npractice of visualising boundary layer flow on\nmodels, particularly as the technique is simple and\nrapid .  it would greatly assist the\ninterpretation of force measurements and the more detailed\nexplorations of the boundary layer by total\nhead tubes and hot wires .\n  the use of oil smoke is not limited to\nboundary layer flow visualisation .  the apparatus\ndescribed in this report would seem to be\nparticularly suited for educational work in small\ndemonstration tunnels .\n",

(1) a relatively simple turbulent theory which is\nbased on recent theoretical work and which takes into account\nthe upstream history of the boundary layer, and (2) the flat-plate\nreference-enthalpy theory, which depends on only /local/\nconditions .  although both theories are in reasonable agreement with\nthe data, the latter method is simpler and somewhat more\naccurate .\n  for transitional flow the theory mentioned first can be readily\nmodified in order to permit reasonable estimates of transitional\nheat transfer to be obtained .  on this basis it is possible to\nestimate laminar, transitional, and fully developed turbulent heat\ntransfer under hypersonic blunt-body conditions .\n  the behavior of transition reynolds number based on\nmomentum thickness is also discussed and shown to be in quantitative\nagreement with recent shock-tube measurements .\n",

        "content": "various aerodynamic characteristics in hypersonic rarefied\ngas flow .\n  this paper considers the problem of calculating viscous\naerodynamic characteristics of blunt bodies at hypersonic speeds and\nat sufficiently high altitudes where the appropriate mean free\npath becomes too large for the use of familiar boundary-layer\ntheory but not so large that free molecule concepts apply .\n  results of an order-of-magnitude analysis are presented to\ndefine the regimes of rarefied gas flow and the limits of\ncontinuum theory .  based on theoretical and experimental\nevidence, the complete navier-stokes equations are used as a\nmodel, except /very close/ to the free molecule condition .  this\nmodel may not necessarily give the shock wave structure in\ndetail but satisfies overall conservation laws and should give a\nreasonably accurate picture of all mean aerodynamic quantities .\n  in this /intermediate/ regime there are two fundamental classes\nof problems ..  a /viscous layer/ class and a /merged layer/\nclass, the latter corresponding to a larger degree of rarefaction .\nfor the viscous layer class there is a thin shock wave, but the\nshock layer region between the shock and the body is fully\nviscous, although the viscous stresses and conductive heat transfer\nare small at the shock wave boundary .  here, the use of the\nnavier-stokes equations with outer boundary conditions given\nby the hugoniot relations is justified .  for the merged layer\nclass, the shock wave is no longer thin, and the navier-stokes\nequations can be used to give a solution which includes the shock\nstructure and has free-stream conditions as outer boundary\nconditions .  a simpler procedure is presented for /incipient merged/\nconditions where the shock may no longer be considered an\ninfinitesimally thin discontinuity but where it has not thickened\nsufficiently to entail the /fully merged layer/ analysis .  in this\ncase we approximate the shock by a discontinuity obeying\nconservation laws which include curvature effects, viscous stresses,\nand heat conduction .\n  for a sphere and cylinder it is shown that the navier-stokes\nequations can be reduced to ordinary differential equations for\nboth the viscous and merged layer class of problems .  solutions\nof these equations, when used in connection with hypersonic flow\nproblems, are in general only valid in the stagnation region .  to\nillustrate the viscous layer solutions, numerical calculations\nhave been performed for a sphere and cylinder with the\nassumption of constant density in the shock layer, which is a useful\napproximation at hypersonic speeds .  to illustrate the merged\nlayer solution, calculations have been carried out for a sphere\nusing the incipient merged layer approximation .\n  results are presented for detachment distance, surface shear,\nand heat-transfer rate in the stagnation region of a highly cooled\nsphere flying at hypersonic speed .  with decreasing reynolds\nnumber, the shear and heat transfer are shown to increase above\nthe extrapolated boundary-layer values in the viscous layer\nregime and then to begin falling in the incipient merged regime .\nas the reynolds number decreases in the incipient merged\nregime, the density in the shock layer increases, and the static\nand stagnation enthalpy behind the shock decrease .\n  calculations performed for an insulated sphere show that, with\ndecreasing reynolds number in the incipient merged regime,\nthe density in the shock layer decreases,. the total enthalpy\nbehind the shock and at the stagnation point increase so that they\nare higher than the free-stream total enthalpy,. and the\nstagnation-point pressure behaves like the total enthalpy .\n  for the highly cooled cylinder in the viscous layer regime, the\nsame quantities are presented as for the sphere .  the increase\nfound in shear and heat transfer above extrapolated\nboundary-layer theory is small, in agreement with vorticity interaction\ntheory .\n  a discussion is given of the behavior of available experimental\ndata for viscous flow quantities in the intermediate regime and\nthe behavior predicted by the results of the present calculations .\nqualitative agreement is indicated .\n",

(1) sharp\nleading edge., (2) blunt leading edge, as approximated by a normal\nshock wave .  the streamlines that enter the boundary layer over a large\nregion of the plate surface has previously crossed the shock wave\nvery near the leading-edge, where the shock is strong and highly\ncurved .  consequently, the temperature at the outer edge of the\nboundary layer is appreciably higher than free-stream temperature,\nand the vorticity there is not zero .  the effects of this shock-wave\nlarger than the usual /errors/ made in the boundary-layer theory,\nand an estimate of these effects can therefore be obtained within the\nframework of that theory .  the numerical magnitude of the shock-wave\ninfluence is found to be appreciable .  for the case of the blunt\nleading edge the slope of the curve of induced pressures plotted against\nthe hypersonic interaction parameter closely approaches the experimental\ndata of hammitt and bogdonoff obtained in helium at large values of this\nparameter .  these approximate results show that the influence of the\nleading-edge region at hypersonic speeds requires careful theoretical\nand experimental study .\n",

(2) there always\nexists a minimum r below which the motion is stable .  a\nsimilar result was obtained by synge from energy\nconsiderations .  synge found a limiting curve below which the\nmotion is necessarily stable .  the author's discussion of the\nasymptotic behavior of the curves shows further\nthat there always exists a maximum value of a beyond\nwhich the motion is stable for all reynolds numbers .  hence\nthe qualitative shape of the curve is determined .\n  the author proceeds to show that simple approximate\nexpressions for the stability limit can be obtained from his\ngeneral analysis for a given velocity profile .  these\napproximate stability limits for plane poiseuille flow and blasius\nflow are found to be r=5906 and r=502 .  the reynolds\nnumbers are based on the width of the channel and the\ndisplacement thickness, respectively .  finally, the method\nfor computing the complete instability curve is presented\nand the plane poiseuille case and the blasius problem worked\nout in detail .  the stability limit for blasius flow had been\ngiven before by tollmien and schlichting .  the present more\nexact computations agree well with tollmien's result as far\nas the minimum critical reynolds number is concerned .\nthe value found here is r=420 .  the neutral curve for\npoiseuille motion had not been obtained before .  the\nminimum critical number here is found to be r=5314 .  the\nagreement with the estimate from the simple criterion\nmentioned above is thus very good .\n  a discussion of the physical significance of the viscous\neffects and of future developments concludes the paper .\n",

(a) the material of the projectile ,.

(these assumptions\nmay be compared with the empirical relations\nsuggested by cope .)\nit is shown that a transformation of the ordinate\nnormal to the layer can lead to a simplified\nform of equation of motion very similar to the\nordinary incompressible equation but modified\nby a multiplicative factor g in the pressure\nterm .  this factor is greater than unity at the\nboundary and tends to one at the outside of\nthe layer .\n  several particular solutions are considered\nincluding accelerated flow with a linearly\nincreasing velocity and retarded flow along a\nflat plate with a linearly decreasing velocity .\n  the general implications of the theory are\ndiscussed and qualitative conclusions are drawn\nwhen the mainstream velocity starts from\na stagnation point, rises to a maximum and\nsubsequently falls .  it is concluded that for\nsuch a velocity distribution increasing\ncompressibility will reduce the skin friction, increase\nthe boundary layer thickness and cause\nearlier separation as compared with the incompressible\nflow with the same mainstream velocity\ndistribution and the kinematic viscosity corresponding\nto conditions at the stagnation point .\n",

(in the ritz method, not even\nthe convergence of the slopes can be\nguaranteed .)  the method yields numerical\nresults for plates of all shapes for which\nthe membrane problem (which we shall call\nthe base problem) admits an explicit\nsolution .  as an example we shall consider a\nclamped square plate under a uniform load .\nthis problem has been the object of\nnumerous investigations, some of which are\ntheoretical, while others are purely numerical,\nuse infinite simple and double series,\nand operate with an infinite number of\nlinear equations and an infinite number of\nunknowns .  an inspection of the general\nformulae derived in the present paper,\nformulae which become simple in numerical\napplications, would show how some of the\nnumerical methods might be rendered\nrigorous .  the convergence of higher\nderivatives is of great practical interest for\nthe approximate computation of the stresses .\n",

        "content": "interaction between shock waves and boundary layers, with a note on the\neffects of the interaction of the performance of supersonic intakes .\nthe interaction between shock waves and boundary layers has important\neffects in many problems of high-speed flow . this paper has been\nwritten as a guide to the literature on the subject, and as a critical\nreview of the present state of knowledge concerning both the underlying\nphysical processes and the practical applications . it will be clear to\nthe reader that, although substantial progress has been made, our\nknowledge is still far from complete and that more work both of a\nfundamental nature and on specific applications is needed before the problem\nis understood sufficiently well for design purposes .\npart i of the paper describes experiments on comparatively simple types\nof flow designed to provide fundamental information and to assist in the\n development of the theory . these experiments show that the interaction\n depends mainly on the mach and reynolds numbers and on the strength of\nthe shock wave . in particular, the interaction of a shock wave with a\nlaminar boundary layer is shown to produce much larger effects than if\nthe boundary layer is turbulent . for most cases where the effects of\nthe interaction are large enough to have serious practical consequences\nit is found that the boundary layer separates from the surface, and the\ndifference between the interaction with laminar and turbulent layers\narises mainly because the laminar layer separates much more readily in\nan adverse pressure gradient . the details of the interaction downstream\n of the separation point thus depend critically on the behaviour of the\nseparated layer, and on the conditions under which it reattaches to the\nsurface .\nmany of the features found in the fundamental experiments appear also in\n practical applications and these are considered in parts ii and iii of\nthe paper . although the emphasis hero is on the performance of\naerfoils and wings moving at high subsonic speeds, the importance of the\ninteraction in other examples such as at supersonic trailing edges and\nin supersonic intakes is also discussed briefly . the differences\nbetween the interaction with laminar and turbulent boundary layers are\noften a source of serious discrepancy between model experiments and\nfull-scale conditions . for small-scale models it is, therefore,\nfrequently essential to make the boundary layer turbulent by artificial\nmeans . some of the difficulties involved in doing this, and certain of\nthe more promising methods are briefly discussed . it is shown that\nexperiments on models with transition fixed can be used to explain a\nnumber of aerodynamic effects encountered in transonic flight, and\nconnected with the occurrence of shock-induced separation of the\nturbulent boundary layers . for both two-dimensional aerofoils and straight\n and sweptback wings, turbulent separation occurs for shocks above a\ncertain strength which applies for both model and full-scale conditions\nfull-scale conditions,. differences in magnitude would be expected if\nthe pressure recovery along the separated layer between the shock and\nthe trailing edge is affected by reynolds number, but little information\n is at present available on this point .\nmost of the repercussions of turbulent separation on the steady-motion\ncharacteristics of aerofoils and wings can be traced to the associated\nreduction in the pressure recovery over the roar of the surface . this\nis because the pressure at the trailing edge controls the inter-relation\n between the two surfaces /so long as the flow at the trailing edge\nremains subsonic/, and in particular the relative movements of the shock\n waves and the extents of the local regions of supersonic flow . certain\n unsteady-flow characteristics such as buffeting and control surface\nseparation .\nsome evidence is presented on the influence of section shape on the\noccurrence and effects of separation, but in this, as in many other\nrespects, information relevant to turbulent boundary layers is scarce .\nsome notes on the further work which is required are given in part iv of\n the paper .\n",

(a similar, but not quite as\ngeneral, method was derived by walkden in\nref. 6 .)  whitham's formula, including only the\nvolume term, has been used extensively to predict\nthe boom intensity of aeroplane type bodies\nand the agreement with experiment has, so far,\nbeen quite reasonable .  the test data obtained\nto date extends only up to about 40,000 ft.\naltitude and the calculations of this paper show\nthat under those conditions the shock noise of\nthe aircraft tested so far will, in most cases,\nbe dominated by the volume term .  it is shown\nthat at higher altitudes lifting effects will\ndominate for even the small fighter and they will\ndominate over most of the altitude range\nfor large bomber and supersonic transport\naircraft .  the boom intensity due to lift decreases\nwith altitude as which compares to\nin the volume case (=pressure at\naltitude h) .  it is insensitive to mach number,\nwing loading, wing plan shape and\nlift distribution .  a simple rule for calculating\nthe shock noise due to combined volume and\nlifting effects is proposed which is applicable to\nconfigurations with wings located towards the\nrear of the fuselage .  the rule states that the shock\nnoise of an aircraft carrying lift is equal\nto the shock noise due to volume (neglecting lift)\nor the shock noise due to lift (neglecting\nvolume), whichever is the greater .  a chart is\npresented from which rapid estimates can be\nmade of the shock noise of lifting\nwing-body combinations .\n",

(1) the effect of\ntransverse shear deformation and (2) the effect of transverse normal stress\ndeformation .  the first of these two effects has been known to be of\nimportance in the theory of plates and beams .  the second effect was\nfound to occur in a manner which is typical for shells and has no\ncounterpart in flat-plate theory .\n  the general results of this report have been applied to the\nsolution of problems concerning flat plates, circular rings, circular\ncylindrical shells, and spherical shells .  in each case numerical\nexamples have been given, illustrating the magnitude of the effects\nof transverse shear and normal stress deformation .\n  the results of this investigation indicate the necessity of\ntaking account of transverse shear and normal stress in sandwich-type\nshells, as soon as there is an order-of-magnitude difference between\nthe elastic constants of the core layer and of the face layers of the\ncomposite shell .  it was found that the changes due to transverse\nshear and normal stress deformation in the core may be so large as to\nbe no mere corrections to the results of the theory without transverse\ncore flexibility .\n  the actual magnitude of the changes is greatly dependent on the\ngeometry and loading condition of the structure under consideration\nso that no general rules may be given which indicate for which elastic\nmodulus ratio the changes begin to be significant .\n  solutions of problems in the present theory may in general be\nobtained by mathematical methods which are similar to those employed\nin the theory of plates and shells without the effect of transverse\nshear and normal stress deformation included .  the present work does\nnot include consideration of buckling and finite deflection effects .\n",

(1) does\nthe combustible material ignite,. and (2) how far\ndownstream of the initial contact point does the flame appear\nand what is the detailed process of development .  since\nthe hot stream is of infinite extent, it is found that ignition\nalways takes place at some point of the stream .  however,\nwhen the temperature of the hot stream drops below a\ncertain value, the distance required for ignition increases\nso enormously that it essentially does not occur in a\nphysical apparatus of finite dimension .  the complete\ndevelopment of the laminar flame front is computed using\nan approximation similar to the integral technique\nintroduced by von karman into boundary layer theory .\n",

        "content": "a theory of the two dimensional laminar bounary layer\nover a curved surface .\n  the purpose of this paper is to present a theory to account for\nsurface curvature effects on the two-dimensional boundary-layer\nflow which approaches a potential flow at free stream .\n  the problem of two-dimensional viscous flow is first formulated\nby using the streamlines and their orthogonal trajectories as the\ngeneralized coordinates .  a boundary-layer approximation is\napplied to the navier-stokes equations and the gauss equation\nin the generalized coordinates to yield the boundary-layer\nequations .  the conditions under which similar solutions of the\nboundary-layer equations exist are determined .  by a simple\ntransformation, the governing differential equation can be\nexpressed in a form which reduces to the falkner-skan equation\nfor zero surface curvature .\n  numerical results for a similar solution which corresponds to a\nflow over a curved surface with zero surface pressure gradient\nhave been obtained .  the velocity profiles in the boundary layer\nand the wall skin-friction distribution for concave and convex\nsurfaces are presented .  the wall skin friction for a convex wall\nis found to be higher than the blasius value for a flat plate .  on\nthe other hand, for a concave wall, the skin friction will drop\nbelow the blasius value as the curvature increases, but it appears to\nreach a minimum, and beyond this minimum point it will increase\nagain .  the same flow problem was treated by murphy by a\ndifferent method of analysis .  comparison of murphy's results\nwith those obtained by the present method reveals some basic\ndifferences in the boundary-layer characteristics .  in particular,\nmurphy's results indicate that the wall skin friction for a convex\nsurface is smaller than the blasius value, while for a concave wall\nit is higher .\n",

        "content": "on the flow in a reflected shock tunnel .\nthe performance of a shock tunnel operated by the reflected-shock\ntechnique is examined theoretically neglecting viscous effects and\nhigh-temperature real-gas effects . particular attention is given to\ndisturbances to the flow at the nozzle entry caused by waves reflected from\n the contact surface when the operating conditions depart from those for\nthat the first disturbance reflected from the contact surface is weak\nenough to be tolerated only within a small range of primary-shock mach\nnumber, m /e.g., 5 7 m 6 3 if the pressure at entry to the nozzle is to\nremain constant to 10 per cent/ . within this range, running times much\nlonger than those obtained in 'straight-through' shock tunnels are\npredicted, the limitation usually being imposed by the arrival of the\nexpansion wave originating at the diaphragm .\noutside this range of mach number, the uniform-flow duration between the\n arrival at the nozzle entry of the primary shock and the first\ndisturbance reflected from the contact surface is shown to be approximately\n equal to the time between the arrival of the primary shock and the\ncontact surface in a 'straight-through' shock tunnel . at first sight it\n appears, therefore, that the advantages of reflected-shock operation\nare confined to a very narrow range of shock mach number, unless a\nheated driver gas is used in order to vary the mach number for\nfurther analysis suggests, however, that subsequent disturbances in the\nmultiple wave reflection process between the contact surface and the end\n of the tube are relatively weak over a useful range of shock mach\nnumber . thus, if the flow after the arrival of the early reflected\ndisturbances is used for test purposes, long running times seem possible in\n theory without severe restrictions to the shock mach number .\nexperiments have been made in a shock tube and a shock tunnel to\nprovide data for comparisons with the results of the simple theory . if\nallowance is made for viscous effects on the motion of the contact\nsurface, fair agreement is found for the disturbances reflected and\ntransmitted by the contact surface, and for the arrival of the expansion wave\nreflection process increases when the shock mach number is raised\nsubstantially above the 'tailored' value, and a limit to the usable flow\nduration may result .\na striking feature of the results is a fall of pressure at the end of\nthe tube immediately after reflection of the primary shock . this is\nattributed to attenuation of the reflected shock resulting from its\ninteraction with the boundary layer on the wall of the tube . further\nresearch is required to check this explanation, and to investigate the\neffects of reynolds number and of the cross-sectional shape and size of\nthe tube . the effects of the tail and reflected head of the expansion\nwave originating at the main diaphragm are discussed . it is shown that\nthe arrival of the reflected head at the nozzle entry may impose a\nsevere limitation to the duration of uniform conditions at low shock\nmach number, and that the arrival of the tail may limit the flow\nduration at high shock mach number . unless means can be devised to\nsuppress the expansion wave, it is demonstrated that it is desirable to\nhave alternative diaphragm positions in a tube required to operate over\na range of shock mach number .\nit is concluded that running times of order 10 milliseconds at a shock\nmach number of 4, falling to, perhaps, 1 millisecond at a shock mach\nnumber of 8 seem possible in a shock tunnel of reasonable size by using\nreflected-shock operation with unheated hydrogen driving air . because\nof the simplifying assumptions of the theoretical investigations, and\nthe deficiencies of the apparatus used for the experiments, the present\ninvestigation must, however, be regarded as preliminary in character .\nfurther research is required to check and extend the findings, and\ntopics particularly requiring investigation are listed in the paper .\n",
